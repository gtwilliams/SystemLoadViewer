Jeesh!  These kids are so irritating.

KDE had a nice widget to show the system load and memory usage in the
panel.  They finally rewrote it after plasma killed the old applets.

Then...

They refused to make the tooltip interactive so you could leave it
displaying while you watched things change.  Well, that was a very
small change that I began doing myself after they refused my PR.

Just recently, they decided that the very useful display of cached
memory was not useful to anyone and removed it.  The argument, such as
it was, is here:

    https://phabricator.kde.org/D11558 

(A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds...)

So I decided to maintain my own copy of this nice little applet.  This
repository contains my changes to restore the cached memory display
and make the tooltip interactive so that you can actually get a chance
to read it.

The install file contains a script to modify my version in Fedora.
Your mileage may vary.
